			<h2> 14. Sampark Kranti Express </h2>
			<p> Sampark Kranti Express trains are a series of <img class = "img" src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kZnfO4TL0s/maxresdefault.jpg"> Superfast express trains operated by the Indian Railways providing quick connectivity to the national capital, New Delhi or Chandigarh. The words Sampark and Kranti are borrowed from Sanskrit. Sampark means Contact and Kranti means Revolution. The combined name denotes the steps taken by Indian Railways to provide high speed train connections from cities around India with the National Capital through the provision of non-air conditioned express trains with few stops and operating at high speeds. The Sampark Kranti trains operate at slower average speeds than the Rajdhani and Shatabdi series yet still provide high speed options at normal prices due to their few stops and relatively faster speeds compared with other express trains. The Railway Minister (India) at the time Nitish Kumar in the interim Railway Budget of 2004-05 announced the launch of Sampark Kranti Express. The trains in the Sampark Kranti series connect the Indian states to the national capital city of New Delhi. Sampark Kranti trains charge the same fare as regular/superfast trains on the Indian Railways rail network and do not provide any special facilities not available in regular Express trains. The initial decision of non-stop run of this Express series of trains was cut short and was given way to commercial stopping outside the states.[2] The trains aim at reducing travel time without compromising on passenger comfort. The Karnataka Sampark Kranti Express from Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin to Yesvantpur was the first train which was launched on 8 February 2004. Currently there are 23 Sampark Kranti Express in India</p>

			<h2> 15. Local trains </h2>
			<p> Suburban/local trains plays a major role in the <img src = "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.9FIdl7DRCWaxJvgbzVNmMgHaEK?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" class = "img"> public transport system of many major Indian cities. These services are operated by Indian Railways. Suburban rail is a rail service between a central business district and the suburbs, a conurbation or other locations that draw large numbers of people daily. The suburban rail systems in Hyderabad, Pune, Lucknow–Kanpur and Bengaluru do not have dedicated suburban tracks but share tracks with long-distance trains. The suburban rail system of Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai have both dedicated tracks and tracks shared with long-distance trains. The first suburban rail system in India is Mumbai Suburban Railway which started operations in 1853. The Kolkata Suburban Railway has the largest network in the entire country. Suburban trains that handle commuter traffic are all electric multiple units (EMUs). They usually have nine or twelve coaches, sometimes even fifteen to handle rush hour traffic. One unit of an EMU train consists of one power car and two general coaches. Thus a nine coach EMU is made up of three units having one power car at each end and one at the middle. The rakes in the suburban rails run on 25 kV AC.  In some cities of India, the opening of rapid transit systems has led to a decline in the use of the suburban rail system. MEMU mainline elecric multiple units and DEMU (diesel electric multiple units) are also used in suburban rail </p>
